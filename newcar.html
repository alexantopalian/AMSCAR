    <p>I will guide you in your decision of what type of car is best for you, without you having to set foot on the dealer lot.
Then I will find your car at the best price, eliminating all of the dealer traps. The typical back and forth negotiation game that dealers normally play will be completely eliminated. As your agent I make sure that you remain in the power position throughout the process.
<br><br>I am sitting at your side during the entire process, never taking my eyes off of every detail that is involved. Most of what the dealers will be presenting will be new to you. However, I am very familiar with every detail and well versed in everything that happens during the process.
<br><br>

I will advise you on the best financing rates and prices for items such as extended warranties and GAP insurance (provided they make sense for your investment). Dealers understand that I sit through deals every day and they know that they cannot play the same games with me in the room as your agent. End result is that you save money on many different levels throughout the entire transaction.
<br><br> There is NEVER any pressure to buy.
All that is left is to sign paperwork which I will have for the most part completely prepared.
The car will be ready for you to drive away. A completely hassle-free process.
I will save you time, money and make the process efficient and enjoyable.
I donâ€™t cost money. I save you money
