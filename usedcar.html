    <p>As a general rule of thumb I donâ€™t recommend used car purchases under $8000.
After an initial phone consultation and you are comfortable moving forward with the process you then provide me a wish list of everything you are looking for in a car.
For example, you may be looking for certain options in a car; 2 or 4 door, automatic or stick and certain options and color combination.
 I take your wish list and put it together with my time tested list of criteria which includes the following: accident free, original owner, dealer maintained, garage kept, proper records, highway miles and other hard to find variables which, in the end, make for a very nicely kept vehicle that will give you years of safe and reliable service. Most, if not all these criteria will be met.
There is a lot of work involved in finding the car that best matches your wish list and my criteria. I will sifted through hundreds of  cars that have to pass my test for high quality. The one or two cars that I finally look at will be the Right One for You.
I also will have checked the complete history of the car and provided a thorough on-site inspection. Finally, I negotiate or purchase on your behalf, getting you the best car at the best price. I also provide guidance in handling all of the DMV paperwork.
In the end, most consumers can SAVE hundreds if not thousands of dollars by hiring a professional to broker the purchase of their next car. But beyond the dollars, you're also saving hours of hassle in avoiding the traditional walk-up or even an Internet-based dealership experience. And that can be the most valuable benefit of all.
